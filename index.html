                    problem-to-project approach centered on data literacy for Angelenos interested in using
                    neighborhood-based data to solve their community needs.

                    strategic partnerships, demographic data research, and implementing design thinking principles to
                    identify ways to engage LA’s residents considered at high risk of being undercounted.
