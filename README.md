## Description 
An apportunity to share my work in one place making it easy for any interested party to view and connect with me. I have also attached my resume, work samples, and shared my personal contact information.

I learned to built a hierarchical/order of information from document to document thus making the work easy to track. While also making my final product be more in agreement with all of its complex parts.
