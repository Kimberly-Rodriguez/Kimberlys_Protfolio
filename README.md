# Kimberly's Porfolio Project

An apportunity to share my work in one place making simple and accessible for any interested party to view and connect with me. I have also attached my github work samples, resume and personal contact information.

This project was built using HTML and CSS principles.

I learned to built a hierarchical/order of information from document to document thus making the work easy to track. While also making my final product be more in agreement with all of its complex parts.
